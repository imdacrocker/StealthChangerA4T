Print Settings

Since the files were pulled from a few different projects, there are a couple of caveats to the settings

First, you can use standard Voron settings for the line width and height

But the A4T was designed WITHOUT shrinkage in mind.  So you need to calibrate shrinkage, and use that in your slicer

The dock was cut from the shape of the A4T, so you will need to print that with shrinkage compensation as well

Second, the backplate was designed WITH shrinkage in mind.  So when you print that piece, it is expected that you will print it in ABS or ASA, with NO shrinkage compensation

The rest of the parts are not that picky, and can be printed with or without compensation
